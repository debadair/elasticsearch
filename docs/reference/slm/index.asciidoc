= Managing the snapshot lifecycle

[partintro]
--
You can set up snapshot lifecycle policies to automate the timing, frequency, and retention of snapshots. 
Snapshot policies can apply to multiple indices. 

Like ILM, snapshot lifecycle management (SLM) is supported by a set of 
<<snapshot-lifecycle-management-api, CRUD APIs>>
that enable you to manage snapshot lifecycle policies. 
You can also manually trigger a snapshot policy and start and stop SLM.  

To disable SLM entirely, set `xpack.slm.enabled` to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`.
