[[slm-api-stop-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`POST /_slm/stop`

[[slm-api-stop-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage_slm`
cluster privilege to use this API. For more information, see
<<security-privileges>>.

[[slm-api-stop-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Halts all snapshot lifecycle management operations and stops the SLM plugin.
This is useful when you are performing maintenance on the cluster and need to
prevent SLM from performing any actions on your indices. 
Stopping SLM does not stop any snapshots that are in progress.
You can manually trigger snapshots with the <<slm-api-execute-lifecycle>> even if SLM is stopped.

Returns as soon as the request is acknowledged, but 
the plugin might continue to run until in-progress operations complete and it can be safely stopped. 
Use the  <<slm-api-get-status>> to see if SLM is running. 

==== Request Parameters
